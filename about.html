        <p>
            Hi! I'm currently a student at Coder Academy, studying the CCC course - Coding, Cloud and Cybersecurity.
        <br>
            My background is in hospitality in which I have worked for the last 10 years.
             I specialized specifically in the coffee and cafe side of the industry, having worked mostly as a speciality coffee barista. 
             I have spent the later years of my coffee career as a barista 
             trainer, which I am internationally recognized to teach courses developed by the Speciality Coffee Association. 
             Like most industies, the coffee industry is changing rapidly with the progression of technology. 
             <br>
            My hope is to develope my skills in coding and technology and combine my expertise in coffee to stay ahead of the curve.
