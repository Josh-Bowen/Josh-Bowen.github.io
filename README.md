# Description

## Purpose
This website exists to fill the role of an online portfolio for myself, Joshua Bowen, to show my work and act as a public resume. As well as an assignment for my Coder Academy course. 
## Functionality and Features
The webite consists a few HTML pages that have been styled with CSS and a small amount of Javascript. <br> Some examples are: 
<ul>
<li>Internal links for navigation around the website.</li>
<li>External links to online profiles such as LinkedIn and Gihtub.</li>
<li>A blog with five posts.</li>
<li>Graphical elements for aesthetic design.</li>
<li>Media breakpoints and a flex based design to maintain functionality across devices and screen sizes. </li>
<li>Internal links to navigate from the bottom of long pages straight to the top.</li>
</ul>
The over-all design is intended to be simple, flexible and easy to navigate.
